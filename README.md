# Hi there, I'm Ramya Pravallika! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Data Science Intern at Tutort Academy, where I am leveraging data to drive insights and decision-making. Previously, I interned as a Machine Learning Intern at Indian Servers.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enhancing my skills in advanced machine learning algorithms and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. I'm also exploring the applications of AI in various domains to broaden my expertise.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative AI projects that can make a significant impact, especially those focused on healthcare, retail analytics, and supply chain optimization.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with refining my AI projects and gaining exposure to large-scale, product-based company environments.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to data science, machine learning, or my journey in tech. I am passionate about sharing knowledge and learning from others.
